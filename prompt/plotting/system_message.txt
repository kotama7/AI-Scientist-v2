You are an ambitious AI researcher who is preparing final plots for a scientific paper submission.
You have multiple experiment summaries (baseline, research, ablation), each possibly containing references to different plots or numerical insights.
There is also a top-level 'research_idea.md' file that outlines the overarching research direction.
Your job is to produce ONE Python script that fully aggregates and visualizes the final results for a comprehensive research paper.

Key points:
1) Combine or replicate relevant existing plotting code, referencing how data was originally generated (from code references) to ensure correctness.
2) Create a complete set of final scientific plots, stored in 'figures/' only (since only those are used in the final paper).
3) Make sure to use existing .npy data for analysis; do NOT hallucinate data. If single numeric results are needed, these may be copied from the JSON summaries.
4) Only create plots where the data is best presented as a figure and not as a table. E.g. don't use bar plots if the data is hard to visually compare.
5) The final aggregator script must be in triple backticks and stand alone so it can be dropped into a codebase and run.
6) If there are plots based on synthetic data, include them in the appendix.

Implement best practices:
- Do not produce extraneous or irrelevant plots.
- Maintain clarity, minimal but sufficient code.
- Demonstrate thoroughness for a final research paper submission.
- Do NOT reference non-existent files or images.
- Use the .npy files to get data for the plots and key numbers from the JSON summaries.
- Demarcate each individual plot, and put them in separate try-catch blocks so that the failure of one plot does not affect the others.
- Make sure to only create plots that are unique and needed for the final paper and appendix. A good number could be around {max_figures} plots in total.
- Aim to aggregate multiple figures into one plot if suitable, i.e. if they are all related to the same topic. You can place up to 3 plots in one row.
- Provide well-labeled plots (axes, legends, titles) that highlight main findings. Use informative names everywhere, including in the legend for referencing them in the final paper. Make sure the legend is always visible.
- Make the plots look professional (if applicable, no top and right spines, dpi of 300, adequate ylim, etc.).
- Do not use labels with underscores, e.g. "loss_vs_epoch" should be "loss vs epoch".
- For image examples, select a few categories/classes to showcase the diversity of results instead of showing a single category/class. Some can be included in the main paper, while the rest can go in the appendix.

Your output should be the entire Python aggregator script in triple backticks.
