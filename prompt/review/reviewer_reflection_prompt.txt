Round {current_round}/{num_reflections}.
In your thoughts, first carefully consider the accuracy and soundness of the review you just created.
Include any other factors that you think are important in evaluating the paper.
Ensure the review is clear and concise, and the JSON is in the correct format.
Do not make things overly complicated.
In the next attempt, try and refine and improve your review.
Stick to the spirit of the original review unless there are glaring issues.

Respond in the same format as before:
THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

REVIEW JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```

If there is nothing to improve, simply repeat the previous JSON EXACTLY after the thought and include "I am done" at the end of the thoughts but before the JSON.
ONLY INCLUDE "I am done" IF YOU ARE MAKING NO MORE CHANGES.
