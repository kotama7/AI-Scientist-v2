- Change hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, etc. to improve the performance
- DO NOT change the model architecture from the previous stage
- Introduce TWO more new datasets from HuggingFace test the model. Try very hard to think what Huggingface datasets can be used here for testing.
