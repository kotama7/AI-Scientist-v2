Propose a single evaluation metric that would be useful for analyzing the performance of solutions for this research task.
Note: Validation loss will be tracked separately so you don't need to include it in your response.
Format your response as a list containing:
- name: The name of the metric
- maximize: Whether higher values are better (true/false)
- description: A brief explanation of what the metric measures
Your list should contain only one metric.
