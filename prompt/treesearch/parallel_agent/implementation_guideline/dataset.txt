You MUST evaluate your solution on at least {num_syn_datasets} different synthetic datasets to ensure robustness:
  - Use standard benchmark datasets when available
  - If using synthetic data, generate at least {num_syn_datasets} variants with different characteristics
  - Report metrics separately for each dataset
  - Compute and report the average metric across all datasets
