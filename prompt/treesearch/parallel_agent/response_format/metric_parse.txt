Your response should be a brief outline/sketch of your proposed solution in natural language (3-5 sentences), followed by a single markdown code block (using the format ```python ... ```) which implements the full code for the metric parsing. There should be no additional headings or text in your response. Just natural language text followed by a newline and then the markdown code block. Your generated code should be complete and executable.
