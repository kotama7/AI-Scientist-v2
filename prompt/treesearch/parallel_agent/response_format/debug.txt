Your response should be a brief outline/sketch of your proposed solution in natural language (3-5 sentences), followed by a single markdown code block (using the format ```python ... ```) which implements the full code including the bugfix/solution. There should be no additional headings or text in your response. Just natural language text followed by a newline and then the markdown code block. Your generated code should be complete and executable. Do not omit any part of the code, even if it was part of a previous implementation.Make sure to write concise code.
