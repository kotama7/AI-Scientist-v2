Your response should be a brief outline/sketch of your proposed solution in natural language (7-10 sentences), followed by a single markdown code block (using the format ```python ... ```) which implements this solution and prints out the evaluation metric(s) if applicable. There should be no additional headings or text in your response. Just natural language text followed by a newline and then the markdown code block. Make sure to write concise code.
