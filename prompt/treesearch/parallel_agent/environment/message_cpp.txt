Your solution can use any relevant C++ libraries such as: {pkg_str}. Assume the toolchain includes g++, CMake, pybind11, and libtorch for machine learning workflows. Prefer widely used C++ libraries for data handling, numerics, and visualization, and rely on matplotlib bindings or compatible libraries when generating plots saved to PNG. All listed packages are already available.
