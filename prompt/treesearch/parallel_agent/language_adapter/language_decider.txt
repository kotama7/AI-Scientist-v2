You are reviewing an AI research experiment idea to decide which implementation language the automated agent should use.

Consider:
- Stay with Python when the idea, datasets, tooling, or prior work clearly rely on Python-specific libraries or when no strong preference is expressed.
- Choose C++ only if the idea emphasizes C++, systems-level implementation, performance-critical native code, or explicitly avoids Python.

Return exactly one token: either `python` or `cpp`.
