You are given multiple experiment logs from different "nodes". Each node represents attempts and experiments exploring various scientific ideas.

One key point is that these nodes collectively illustrate a stage of testing different methods or approaches. The crucial task is to identify the scientific insights gleaned from this stage. For example, if one node tries method A and another node tries method B, you should compare any observed differences in performance or outcomes. Summarize both experiments in "Experiment_description", explain the processes in "Description", and place any key numerical findings (such as accuracy metrics, loss values, or runtime comparisons) in "Key_numerical_results."

Be concise and avoid repeating the same information from different nodes. You are encouraged to be thorough, but you do not need to include information from every node. Reason carefully about which results from which nodes are scientifically insightful.

The name of this stage of the experiment: {stage_name}

Here are the experiment logs of the nodes:
