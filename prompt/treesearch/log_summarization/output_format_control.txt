Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```

In <THOUGHT>, thoroughly reason as an expert researcher. First, reason about each node, and then reason carefully by combining all the information. It is okay to be very detailed.

In <JSON>, provide the review in JSON format with the following fields in exactly this order:
- "Experiment_description": a string describing the conducted experiments
- "Significance": a string explaining why these experiments are important and what impact their findings might have
- "Description": a string describing the methods, steps taken, and any pertinent context needed to understand the experiments
- "List_of_included_plots": a list of plots that should be included. Each entry should include:
  • "path" (the plot path)
  • "description" (its original description)
  • "analysis" (your analysis of its scientific insights)
- "Key_numerical_results": a list of all important numerical results. Be selective about results that contribute to scientific insights. Each entry should include:
  • "result" (float number)
  • "description" (your short description of the result)
  • "analysis" (your analysis of its scientific insights)

Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted, as it will be automatically parsed.
