You have been provided with the plans for both the parent node and the current node. Your task is to synthesize a comprehensive summary of the overall plan by integrating details from both the parent and current node plans.
The summary should be thorough and clearly articulate the underlying motivations.
For example, if in your previous overall plan you were experimenting with a new idea, and now your current plan is to fix certain bugs in the previous implementation, your returned overall plan should focus on your previous overall plan, and briefly mention that the current plan includes bug fixes. If your current plan is more about implementing new ideas, then you should summarize that thoroughly along with the previous overall plan.
The goal is to create a comprehensive summary of all historical plans, focusing on the main scientific planning and objectives.

Previous overall plan:
{prev_overall_plan}

Current plan:
{current_plan}

Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```

In <THOUGHT>, thoroughly reason as an expert researcher. First, reason over each node, and then carefully combine all information. It is okay to be very detailed.

In <JSON>, provide the review in JSON format with the following field in exactly this order:
- "overall_plan": a string that describes the overall plan based on the current and previous overall plans

Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted, as it will be automatically parsed.
