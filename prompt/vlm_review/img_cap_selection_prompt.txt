The abstract of the paper is:

{abstract}

You will be given an image via the vision API. As a careful scientist reviewer, your task is to:
  1. Examine the provided image closely.
  2. Describe in detail what the image shows in a scientific manner.
  3. Critically analyze whether the image content aligns with the given caption:

{caption}

  4. We also have references in the main text that mention the figure:

{main_text_figrefs}

  5. We have limited pages to present contents:

{reflection_page_info}

You should:
  - Examine the figure in detail: conclude elements in figures (e.g. name of axis) and describe what information is shown (e.g. the line of loss decreases monotonically but plateaus after X epochs)
  - Critique the caption: does it accurately describe the figure? Is it too long/short? Does it include a concise takeaway?
  - Review how well the main text references (figrefs) explain the figure: are they missing? Do they adequately describe the figure's content, context, or purpose?

After considering all of the above, you should carefully evaluate:
  - Given the current page limit, does this image and its relevant text add significant value to the paper's scientific argument?
  - Given the current page limit, is this image too sparse in information? Should it be combined with other figures in the main text?
  - Does this figure contain subfigures?
  - Is this figure not very informative? For example, some figures may show bars with very similar heights that are difficult to distinguish, or present data in a way that does not effectively communicate meaningful differences or patterns.

Finally, respond in the following format:

<THOUGHT>

REVIEW JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```
In <JSON>, provide the review in JSON format with the following fields in the order:
- "Img_description": "<Describe the figure's contents here>"
- "Img_review": "<Your analysis of the figure itself, including any suggestions for improvement>"
- "Caption_review": "<Your assessment of how well the caption matches the figure and any suggestions>"
- "Figrefs_review": "<Your thoughts on whether the main text references adequately describe or integrate the figure>"
- "Overall_comments": "<Your thoughts on whether this figure adds significant value to the paper. Should it be moved to the appendix or not?>"
- "Containing_sub_figures": "<Does this figure contain multiple sub-figures? Do you think the information in this figure is dense? If not, would you suggest combining it with other figures in the main text? If it contains subplots, are their sizes and positions nicely aligned? If not, describe the issues.>"
- "Informative_review": "<Is this figure informative? Does it effectively communicate meaningful differences or patterns? Or does it show data in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish differences (e.g. bars with very similar heights)?"

In <THOUGHT>, first, thoroughly reason through your observations, analysis of alignment, and any suggested improvements. It is okay to be very long.
Then provide your final structured output in <JSON>.
Make sure the JSON is valid and properly formatted, as it will be parsed automatically.
