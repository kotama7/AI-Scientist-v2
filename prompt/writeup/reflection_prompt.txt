Now let's reflect and identify any issues (including but not limited to):
1) Are there any LaTeX syntax errors or style violations we can fix? Refer to the chktex output below.
2) Is the writing clear, and scientifically rigorous?
3) Have we included all relevant details from the summaries without hallucinating?
4) The following figures are available in the folder but not used in the LaTeX: {unused_figs}
5) The following figure references in the LaTeX do not match any actual file: {invalid_figs}
{reflection_page_info}
chktex results:
```
{check_output}
```

Please provide a revised complete LaTeX in triple backticks, or repeat the same if no changes are needed.
Return the entire file in full, with no unfilled placeholders!
This must be an acceptable complete LaTeX writeup.
Do not hallucinate any details!

If you believe you are done, simply say: "I am done".
