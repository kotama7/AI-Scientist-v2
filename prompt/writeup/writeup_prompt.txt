Your goal is to write up the following idea:

```markdown
{idea_text}
```

We have the following experiment summaries (JSON):
```json
{summaries}
```

We also have a script used to produce the final plots (use this to see how the plots are generated and what names are used in the legend):
```python
{aggregator_code}
```
Please also consider which plots should naturally be grouped together as subfigures.

Available plots for the writeup (use these filenames):
```
{plot_list}
```

We also have VLM-based figure descriptions:
```
{plot_descriptions}
```

Your current progress on the LaTeX write-up is:
```latex
{latex_writeup}
```

Produce the final version of the LaTeX manuscript now, ensuring the paper is coherent, concise, and reports results accurately.
Return the entire file in full, with no unfilled placeholders!
This must be an acceptable complete LaTeX writeup.

Please provide the updated LaTeX code for 'template.tex', wrapped in triple backticks
with "latex" syntax highlighting, like so:

```latex
<UPDATED LATEX CODE>
```
