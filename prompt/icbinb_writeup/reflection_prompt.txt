Now let's reflect and identify any issues (including but not limited to):
1) Are there any LaTeX syntax errors or style violations we can fix? Refer to the chktex output below.
2) Is the writing clear, and scientifically rigorous for a workshop focusing on real-world pitfalls?
3) Have we included all relevant details from the summaries without hallucinating?
4) Are there short sections (one or two sentences) that could be combined into a single paragraph?
5) Can we use more information and details (hyperparameters, unused figures, etc.) in the supplementary material? Only add information that is not already covered in the main paper.
6) The following figures are available in the folder but not used in the LaTeX: {unused_figs}
7) The following figure references in the LaTeX do not match any actual file: {invalid_figs}
{reflection_page_info}
chktex results:
```
{check_output}
```
8) Issues identified in the VLM reviews of the images, their captions, and related text discussions. Ensure each caption clearly matches its image content and that there is substantial discussion of each figure in the text.
VLM reviews:
```
{review_img_cap_ref}
```

9) Duplicate figures between main text and appendix. Make sure to remove the duplicate figures from the appendix.
```
{analysis_duplicate_figs}
```

Please provide a revised complete LaTeX in triple backticks, or repeat the same if no changes are needed.
Return the entire file in full, with no unfilled placeholders!
This must be an acceptable complete LaTeX writeup.
Do not hallucinate any details!
Ensure proper citation usage:
- Always include references within \begin{{filecontents}}{{references.bib}} ... \end{{filecontents}}, even if they haven't changed from the previous round.
- Use citations from the provided references.bib content.
