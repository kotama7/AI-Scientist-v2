{Idea}
```

You produced the following report:
```markdown

Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

RESPONSE:
```json
<JSON>

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason and identify which citations are missing.
If no more citations are needed, add "No more citations needed" to your thoughts.
Do not add "No more citations needed" if you are adding citations this round.

In <JSON>, respond in JSON format with the following fields:
- "Description": The purpose of the desired citation and a brief description of what you are looking for.
- "Query": The search query to find the paper (e.g., attention is all you need).
This JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.
