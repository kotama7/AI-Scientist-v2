Now let's reflect on
The following figures are currently used in the paper: {used_figs}
The following figures are available in the folder but not used in the LaTeX: {unused_figs}

{reflection_page_info}

The following is the VLM review on figures:

{review_img_selection}

Please review the figures and make the following changes:
1. For figures that do not add significant value to the paper, move them to the appendix
2. For figures that are not very informative or do not effectively communicate meaningful patterns, remove them entirely
3. For figures that does not contain subfigures and present sparse information, consider combining them with other related figures
4. Update all relevant text discussions to reflect any changes in figure placement or combinations
5. Enhance the scientific analysis of the remaining figures in the text - provide detailed, insightful discussions of their significance and findings

Please ensure all changes maintain scientific rigor and improve the paper's clarity and impact.
Be more aggressive with figure selection - move more figures to the appendix or group them together with other figures if the page limit is already exceeded.

If you believe you are done with reflection, simply say: "I am done".
